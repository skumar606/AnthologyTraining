        A massive open online course (MOOC /muːk/) is an online course aimed at unlimited participation and open access
        via the Web.[1] In addition to traditional course materials, such as filmed lectures, readings, and problem
        sets, many MOOCs provide interactive courses with user forums or social media discussions to support community
        interactions among students, professors, and teaching assistants (TAs), as well as immediate feedback to quick
        quizzes and assignments. MOOCs are a widely researched development in distance education,[2] first introduced in
        2008,[3] that emerged as a popular mode of learning in 2012.[4][5][6]

        Early MOOCs (cMOOCs: Connectivist MOOCs) often emphasized open-access features, such as open licensing of
        content, structure and learning goals, to promote the reuse and remixing of resources. Some later MOOCs (xMOOCs:
        extended MOOCs) use closed licenses for their course materials while maintaining free access for students.

        Precursors
        Main article: Distance learning
        Before the Digital Age, distance learning appeared in the form of correspondence courses in the 1890s–1920s and
        later radio and television broadcast of courses and early forms of e-learning. Typically fewer than five percent
        of
        the students would complete a course.[11] For example the Stanford Honors Cooperative Program, established in
        1954,
        eventually offered video classes on-site at companies, at night, leading to a fully accredited Master's degree.
        This
        program was controversial because the companies paid double the normal tuition paid by full-time students.[12]
        The
        2000s saw changes in online, or e-learning and distance education, with increasing online presence, open
        learning
        opportunities, and the development of MOOCs.[13] By 2010 audiences for the most popular college courses such as
        "Justice" with Michael J. Sandel and "Human Anatomy" with Marian Diamond were reaching millions.[14]

        Tabulation of the significant differences between xMOOC and cMOOC.[15]
        The first MOOCs emerged from the open educational resources (OER) movement, which was sparked by MIT
        OpenCourseWare
        project.[16] The OER movement was motivated from work by researchers who pointed out that class size and
        learning
        outcomes had no established connection, with Daniel Barwick's work being the most often-cited example.[17][18]

        Within the OER movement, the Wikiversity was founded in 2006 and the first open course on the platform was
        organised
        in 2007. Ten-week course with more than 70 students was used to test the idea of making Wikiversity an open and
        free
        platform for education in the tradition of Scandinavian free adult education, Folk High School and the free
        school
        movement.[19] The term MOOC was coined in 2008 by Dave Cormier of the University of Prince Edward Island in
        response
        to a course called Connectivism and Connective Knowledge (also known as CCK08). CCK08, which was led by George
        Siemens of Athabasca University and Stephen Downes of the National Research Council, consisted of 25
        tuition-paying
        students in Extended Education at the University of Manitoba, as well as over 2200 online students from the
        general
        public who paid nothing.[20] All course content was available through RSS feeds, and online students could
        participate through collaborative tools, including blog posts, threaded discussions in Moodle, and Second Life
        meetings.[21][22][23] Stephen Downes considers these so-called cMOOCs to be more "creative and dynamic" than the
        current xMOOCs, which he believes "resemble television shows or digital textbooks."[20]

        Other cMOOCs were then developed; for example, Jim Groom from The University of Mary Washington and Michael
        Branson
        Smith of York College, City University of New York hosted MOOCs through several universities starting with
        2011's
        'Digital Storytelling' (ds106) MOOC.[24] MOOCs from private, non-profit institutions emphasized prominent
        faculty
        members and expanded existing distance learning offerings (e.g., podcasts) into free and open online
        courses.[25]

        Alongside the development of these open courses, other E-learning platforms emerged – such as Khan Academy,
        Peer-to-Peer University (P2PU), Udemy, and Alison – which are viewed as similar to MOOCs and work outside the
        university system or emphasize individual self-paced lessons.
