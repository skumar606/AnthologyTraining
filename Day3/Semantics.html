            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            A virtual university provides higher education programs through electronic media, typically the Internet.
            Some
            are bricks-and-mortar institutions that provide online learning as part of their extended university courses
            while others solely offer online courses. They are regarded as a form of distance education. The goal of
            virtual
            universities is to provide access to the part of the population who would not be able to attend a physical
            campus, for reasons such as distance—in which students live too far from a physical campus to attend regular
            classes; and the need for flexibility—some students need the flexibility to study at home whenever it is
            convenient for them to do so.

        <p>
            Some of these organizations exist only as loosely tied combines of universities, institutes or departments
            that
            together provide a number of courses over the Internet, television or other media, that are separate and
            distinct from programs offered by the single institution outside of the combine. Others are individual
            organizations with a legal framework, yet are called "virtual" because they appear only on the Internet,
            without
            a physical location aside from their administration units. Still other virtual universities can be organized
            through specific or multiple physical locations, with or without actual campuses to receive program delivery
            through technological media that is broadcast from another location where professors give televised
            lectures.
        </p>

            Program delivery in a virtual university is administered through Information and communications technology
            such
            as web pages, e-mail and other networked sources.
        </p>
        <p>
            As virtual universities are relatively new and vary widely, questions remain about accreditation and the
            quality
            of assessment.
